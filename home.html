        The purpose of this project was to gain more experience programming in React by 
        creating a list interface. For this assignment, I created a simple shopping website that  
        displays a list of items for purchase as well as a shopping cart that sums up the total price
        of the purchase.

          Introduction: The Application

          The application is a shopping website for fresh produce. The goal of this website is to allow users to 
          look at produce and to add items to their shopping cart for checkout. In the shopping cart section, which is located
          at the bottom of the page, the users also have the option to add more items or remove items from their cart. Furthermore, they are able to see the total price 
          of their pruchase, and the price is adjusted as users modify their purchase. The value of this shopping website is that it is easy 
          to navigate and use. This is because users are able to look at the products and view their shopping cart all in one page.

          <div id="p">
            <ul>
              <li>Affordance: I wanted users to be able to navigate through the website without actually having to think 
                about how the website should be used. To make it easy for the users to use the website, I clearly placed 
                the filter buttons and the sort by buttons near the products, and I made sure to include two different filter 
                boxes for each filter category (season and size). 
              </li>
              <li>Consistency: Each product item is displayed consistently. It includes information regarding its price, season, and size. 
                Each product "card" also includes an "Add to Cart" button, which allows users to easily add products to their cart. In the shopping 
                cart section, the product "card" changes the "Add to Cart" button with a button that allows users to decremement the quantity of the item, 
                view the quantity of the item in the cart, and increase the quantity of the item. It also includes a separate "Remove" button, which 
                removes the product altogether from the shopping cart regardless of the original quantity. 
              </li>
              <li>Visibility: Users are able to view everything, from the products to the shopping cart, all in one page. I also only 
                included one dropdown menu to minimize hidden information on the page.

                I enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to become more comfortable programming in React. 
                It was also a fun experience for me because I was able to connect programming with design. In the future, I 
                hope that I can take the skills that I learned from this project to create a more advanced React app.
